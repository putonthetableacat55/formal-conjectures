/--
The primary defining sequence `a`.
$a(n)$ is the ascending descending base exponent transform of $2^n$.
$$a(n) = \sum_{i=0}^n 2^{i \cdot 2^{n-i}}$$

def a (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  ∑ i ∈ Finset.range (n + 1), 2 ^ (i * 2 ^ (n - i))

/--
The smallest primes in this (always odd) sequence are $a(1) = 3$, $a(3) = 41$ and $a(5) = 543$.
What is the next prime?
