# Hilbert's Fifth Problem and the Hilbert–Smith Conjecture

The **Hilbert–Smith conjecture** states that a locally compact topological group acting
continuously and faithfully on a connected finite-dimensional topological manifold must be a
Lie group. It remains open in general; Pardon proved it for 3-manifolds in 2013.
An equivalent formulation: no p-adic integer group `ℤ_[p]` can act faithfully on any
connected finite-dimensional topological manifold.

/-- **Hilbert's fifth problem** (Gleason–Montgomery–Zippin, 1952): every Hausdorff,
second-countable topological group modeled on a finite-dimensional Euclidean space is continuously
isomorphic to a real-analytic Lie group.

The input `ChartedSpace` supplies only a topological atlas. The compatible analytic atlas and
analytic group operations belong to the output `LieGroupPresentation`. -/
