How large must $y=y(\epsilon,n)$ be such that the number of integers in
$(x,x+y)$ with a divisor in $(n,2n)$ is at most $\epsilon y$?

A **linear** scale is known to suffice (see `erdos_450.linear_scale_suffices`).
Whether the optimal scale is *sublinear* — a sufficient `Y` with `Y ε n = o(n)` —
is open.

/--
A translate-uniform **linear** scale suffices: there is a sufficient window
length `Y` with `Y ε n ≤ C(ε) · n`. This is an upper bound on the optimal scale,
not the exact threshold asked for in `erdos_450`.
